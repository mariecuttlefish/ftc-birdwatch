<h2>About BIRDWATCH</h2>
<p>Birdwatch is a tool designed for FIRST Tech Challenge competitors that displays an analysis of match scores, team performance, schedule, among other information of a desired FTC event (or group of events).
We hope that this tool assists FIRST teams (primarily scouts) with effective strategy planning and decision making through making data from events more accesible and comprehensible.<br>
This app is being developed by FTC alumnus from team <a href=https://hypebirds.com/>16818 Hype-Birds</a>. Thanks to all teams that are helping with beta-testing.
</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><b><i>Where is the download link?</i></b><br>
Thanks for your enthusiasm! Birdwatch is still under development (we're currently in the beta-testing phase) but it will become freely available eventually.
</p>

<p><b><i>Is it free?</i></b><br>
Yes! 
</p>

<p><b><i>How do you get all of the info about an event?</i></b><br>
We use the official <a href=https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/services/API>FTC Events API</a>.
</p>
<p><b><i>If the info is the same as the FTC events page, then what's the point?</i></b><br>
Birdwatch provides a more in depth analysis of the data, alongside an quick and easy to navigate UI.
</p>

<p><b><i>Does it show match data as it is happening?</i></b><br>
No. Matches are often uploaded as soon as they end.<br>
Please take in mind that the data depends from FIRST's API. In the case that an event's internal system is not connected to the internet, the data won't be updated.
</p>

<p><b><i>What if event data is not being uploaded or I'm at an unofficial event?</i></b><br>
We plan on eventually adding the option to manually add match results, though that might take some time to be implemented.
</p>

<p><b><i>Where can I use Birdwatch?</i></b><br>
Birdwatch is being developed for Windows, Ubuntu, and Android devices. Unfortunately iOS and macOS are not currently supported, due to Apple's development restrictions. The Ubuntu release may work with other Linux distros, but it is not guaranteed that it will work without flaws.
</p>

<p><b><i>Is it supported for other events outside of Mexico?</i></b><br>
As of right now, the tool only displays fixed events from Mexico (that's where we're from ðŸ¤ ) but the final product will display any requested event (as long as it is available in the API). This includes officially registered off-season events.
</p>

<p><b><i>Can I access data from past seasons?</i></b><br>
Due to some variable name changes from the official API's data (mainly from season-specific score methods), the Seagull version of Birdwatch only supports for the 2024-2025 Into the Deep season. Future versions will support ItD alongside upcomming seasons.
In the case that older seasons became supported, the only available seasons are the 2019-2020 Skystone and newer.
</p>

<p><b><i>Why does the app look so... 2000s?</i></b><br>
Birdwatch was developed during the 2024-2025 DIVE season. The design of all FIRST categories this year evoke environmental optimism for the future, with a particular focus towards ocean exploration. We wanted to replicate that optimism in the design. That's why we took cues from Frutiger Aero-inspired interfaces since that's an aesthetic created during an optimistic era. Plus, it stands out from the crowd!
